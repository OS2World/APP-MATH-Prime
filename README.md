Prime Number Generator. PRIME is a 32bit program and uses CWSDPMI.EXE in order to use all of your
computer's available memory. This way, it runs much faster than any similar
16bit program. Put CWSDPMI.EXE in a directory that is in your PATH variable,
or in the same directory as PRIME. If you are running PRIME from an OS/2,
Windows 3.1 or Windows95 DOS session, you do not need CWSDPMI. Note that
CWSDPMI is only needed for the DOS versions of PRIME.
