---------------------------------------------------------------

To capture prime numbers into a text file, type:
    
    PRIME > filename.xxx

Then, hit any key to activate the program; screen will be blank.
By default, prime numbers will be displayed on-screen.


[PRIMEDOS.EXE]
==============

This is the MS-DOS version of PRIME. It has been tested under MS-DOS 6.21
and OS/2 DOS-SESSION. Compiler: djgpp beta2


[PRIME_SX.EXE]
==============

Same as above, but emulates a math coprocessor. This is slower for obvious
reasons but enables people with no DX's to still use it.


[PRIMEOS2.EXE]
==============

OS/2 version of PRIME. Run this in a fullscreen OS/2 Window for maximum
speed. Tested under OS/2 Warp. Compiler: C Set ++ for OS/2 v2.01



[WHAT IS CWSDPMI.EXE?]
======================

PRIME is a 32bit program and uses CWSDPMI.EXE in order to use all of your
computer's available memory. This way, it runs much faster than any similar
16bit program. Put CWSDPMI.EXE in a directory that is in your PATH variable,
or in the same directory as PRIME. If you are running PRIME from an OS/2,
Windows 3.1 or Windows95 DOS session, you do not need CWSDPMI. Note that
CWSDPMI is only needed for the DOS versions of PRIME.
